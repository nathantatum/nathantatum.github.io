Welcome to my personal site/blog!  I'm planning to utilize this to post a mix of personal stuff, work stuff, and side projects.  I haven't had a personal site since my college days when I was trying to learn more about HTML/CSS.  My main motivations are really just to document what I'm working on and hopefully encourage me to write more.  I'm not really a front-end guy, so I'm clearly leveraging someone else's design - specifically [Josh Gerdes](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno).  Stay tuned.
